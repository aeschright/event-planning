h1. Raise money

p. Possible sources of income:

* Contributions from individuals
** put a contribute link on your website
** allow people to contribute during registration
** be transparent about your expenses
* Contributions from companies
** ask your community for contacts
** focus on supporting the community
** be creative about your offerings: logo placement, job listings, mentions in email newsletters, recognition during event, videos, etc.
** don't let the sponsors boss you around
* Registration fees
** free events are great&mdash;cost is not a barrier to attending
** but some events really ought to have a registration fee
* Grants

h1. Pay for things

h2. Option 1: Have contributors pay vendors directly:

* Pros: Requires no setup. Sponsors know exactly what their money is going towards.
* Cons: can be logistically difficult. Hard to pool smaller contributions to pay for expensive things.

h2. Option 2: Have contributors pay individuals on your planning team directly and then have those people pay for things.

* Pros: Requires no setup.
* Cons: Can be difficult to track and is easy to abuse.

h1. Pay for things

h2. Option 3: Use an existing organization for fiscal sponsorship.

* Pros: Possible increase in contributions from 501©(x) status, ability to leverage existing organizational experience, an entity to write checks to and from.
* Cons: A financial overhead of 15-20% is not unusual, possible lack of control, poor execution if the fiscal sponsor is inexperienced or unqualified.

h1. Pay for things

h2. Option 4: Start your own company or non-profit.

* Pros: Control, transparency of process. Setting up a company is easier.
* Cons: It's a lot of work and responsibility. And it takes time.

h1. Pay for things

h2. Some other caveats:

Don't represent yourself as being able to take tax-deductible donations if you are not eligible according to the IRS. Make sure you sign up for a regular business account with PayPal and Google Checkout, etc., and avoid using the words “donation” or “donate” on your website and other materials.

h1. Recruit and manage your volunteers

h2. This can be done for free or cheap

* Write a reusable announcement
* Cross-post everywhere
* Get the whole team involved
* Ask for help from willing partners&mdash;relevant bloggers, user group leaders, mailing list moderators

h1. Arrange for wifi, food, A/V, power, and more

* Your venue may provide these
* Or you could need to contract with outside vendors
** Consider your budget and the needs of your participants
** Make sure the vendor is familiar with the space (schedule walkthroughs)
** Document contact info
** Get it all in writing

h1. Manage the on-site venue logistics fun

h1. Keep it safe, fun, and welcoming: codes of conduct, after parties, and considerations for serving alcohol

Unfortunately, the default in open source is not for events to be open, welcoming and safe for everyone.

If you want your event to be different from that status quo, you'll need to actively work to make it different. Here are some tips for doing so:

* Adopt a code of conduct
* Be mindful when/how you provide alcohol
* Be available for feedback
* Be responsive to incidents
* Recognize positive behavior along with the negative
* Be radically inclusive: food, t-shirts and environment matter

h1. Continue on

h2. Keep the momentum once your first event is over

* Gather feedback from attendees
* Make sure you can contact everyone: collect email addresses, set up a mailing list
* Schedule a retrospective for your team
* It's never too early to start planning the next event
